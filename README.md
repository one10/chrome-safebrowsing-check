chrome-safebrowsing-check
=========================

Submit a URL to safe browsing blacklists

  * Submits a URL from an input box to **YSB** and **GSB** in background tabs
  * Creates an active tab with the **Phishtank** front page, and posts their form to check

  * If you have some proprietary checks (no need to check in), add them in `extra_checks.js`
  * Feel free to add any number of additional blacklists to check (there are many more)
  * Feel free to make it as fancy as you like (e.g., a Chrome context menu perhaps)
